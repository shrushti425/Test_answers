## Recommendation Engine with OOP
Design a simple recommendation engine using OOP principles in Python. The engine should take a user’s previous purchases and return items with similar attributes. Describe the classes you would create, the attributes they would contain, and the methods you would implement to identify similar items based on predefined rules.

ANSWER:

To create a recommendation engine using OOP in Python we will create the following classes:
Firstly there should be something to store the previous searches,Then we’ll create a class to find similar words that contain the same category or a particular keyword.Then whichever is the closest match will be displayed.

## Text Summarizer
You need to create a basic text summarizer that reduces a block of text to its essential points. Using only functions, loops, and conditional statements (no libraries like NLTK or spaCy), describe how you would identify and extract the most important sentences based on their frequency of keywords. What logical steps would you follow, and how would you structure your code?

ANSWER:

Firstly we need to extract the whole text that needs to be summarised. Then we will define a set of keywords.For which we will use list. Then we will read all the sentences and check if the keyword exists in them.For that we will use for loops and conditional if statements. Then we’ll create a set of all the sentences and display it as a  paragraph.
